# Named-Entity-Recognition

This project implements a Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline to identify and categorize entities such as **people**, **locations**, and **organizations** from text data.

## Overview

The pipeline leverages both model-based and rule-based approaches to extract named entities:

- **Model-based:** Utilizes spaCy's small and medium pre-trained language models for entity recognition.
- **Rule-based:** Custom rules to complement model predictions.
- **Visualization:** Interactive visualizations of detected entities using spaCyâ€™s `displaCy`.
- **Comparison:** Comparison of outputs from different models.
- **Export:** Results exported to CSV files for further analysis.

## Features

- Named entity extraction with high accuracy.
- Side-by-side model output comparison.
- Exportable results for easy integration.
- Clear visual output to aid analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- spaCy 
- Pandas
